//  What is the DOM?
   
// DOM = Document Object Model--> browser’s representation of HTML.
// When a web page loads, the browser creates a tree-like structure of the page called the DOM.
// Each HTML element becomes an object (a node) inside this tree, which JavaScript can access and manipulate. Basically Works like a tree of nodes (document → html → head/body → elements).
